    Svn External:

        GtQt can be added to a existing svn project using svn externals.

            Edit the svn externals property in the directory where the GtQt
            library will reside using the following command.
                $ svn propedit svn:externals .

            Add the following line and save
                gtqt https://bently.no-ip.org/svn/gtqt

    Building GtQt:

        Do the following steps in the .pro of the project that will be
        compiling GtQt. It is acceptable to do this in a library project that
        will be making use of the gtqt libraries.

            Define the following variables:
                GTQT_SRC: This is the GtQt source directory.

            Adding the GtQt project files:
                In the .pro of the project that will be utilizing GtQt,
                include the file gtqt/buildgtqt.pri.
